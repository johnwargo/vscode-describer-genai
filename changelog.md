# Change Log

v0.1.4 - March 18, 2024

* Added console.log code back.
* Added check to ensure that the Target Property doesn't contain spaces.

v0.1.3 - March 18, 2024

* Changed format of the image links in `readme.md` to see if I can get them to display in marketplace.
* Changed the contents of the `repository` property in the project's `package.json` file.

v0.1.2

Fixed issue with the project's `.vscodeignore` file. I added the `node_modules` folder to the file and apparently that kept me from being able to load it from Marketplace. 

v0.1.0

Fixed some issues with the readme and `package.json` file.

v0.0.1: February 21, 2024

Initial release.

## Future Plans

* Add support for the [OCI Generative AI Service}(https://www.oracle.com/artificial-intelligence/generative-ai/large-language-models/).
* Add support for [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app).
